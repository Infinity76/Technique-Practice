In this report, I've compiled information about cyclist-related incidents in Austin.

As a result, I'm going to look over these findings to see if the data confirms these incidents through prediction. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102192534/180052577-7dc5d5fe-bdf0-4cb4-96f1-6562a73357e6.png)
